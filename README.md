# hi

you may ask yourself, why are there, aside from some repos that reproduce bugs,
no original repos on this user's profile.

the answer is simple: I do no longer want to support the Torment Nexus.

I have moved all of my personal projects here: https://git.karp.lol/Follpvosten

some stuff is also on codeberg under the same handle.

peace.
